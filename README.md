TODO:
  Fix bug around larger parcels not providing the cheapest delivery option
  task 5 was not started as time ran out
  
Improvements: 
      Calculate helper can be used on instaniation of the shipping class to remove extra steps (however the way conducted has meant that unit testing each method was easier)
      add error handling and relevant unit testing to make more robust with more time in the future, to stick to the time limit and to get as much done as possible, this was put to an after thought
      add an interfact to the shipping service so that when consumed, the implementations can be hidden. this was on the list to do, and in hindsight, could of been done in the templating of the solution first.
      code structures can be improved dramatically, although read-able and kept simple. in a refactoring job later, making the code follow SOLID more closely would be beneficial
